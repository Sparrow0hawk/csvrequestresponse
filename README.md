# csvrequestresponse
CSV request and respond file writer

This is my beginner attempt to design a python programme that will produce a CSV file after requesting information from the user.

This example its based on is using election day sampling, traditionally done at a ballot count with pen and paper as a tally, this 
programme would allow those tallies to be inputted and translated quickly into csv's for further analysis.

It is not yet complete, but I have committed it in it's most recent form.
